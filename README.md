# Training Project

This repository contains the first project I developed as part of my training after joining my first company. The project, built using only HTML and CSS, aimed to help me understand the basics of responsive design and to follow the company's coding standards.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to create a responsive web page using only HTML and CSS, with a focus on maintaining a clean structure and adhering to CSS best practices. After the project evaluation, I received valuable feedback on the company's coding standards and CSS best practices, which has helped me refine my approach to web development.
